## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
My experience working on group/cross-departmental projects and leading and training team members, whilst also providing excellent customer service has given me the ability to communicate effectively in a variety of situations about a multitude of topics.

#### Problem Solving

- I played an instrumental part in transitioning an admin/customer service department that ran very manually (think copying and pasting from spreadsheets and putting post in envelopes by hand), to customer processes becoming almost fully automated, enabling my team to focus on the customers instead of doing manual tasks.
- I was able to manipulate customer data and visualise it in a way that was easily readable for management insights
- I used Google Apps scripts to add automation to Google sheets which were used by my team for daily tasks, to make them more user friendly and efficient

#### Leadership


## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 2023 to July 2023)
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below:
